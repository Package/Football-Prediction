# Football Prediction 

This project is a web based system using C#, ASP .NET MVC, MS SQL Sever 2016+ where you can predict results to [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) football matches. 

This is a similar concept to the [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) however you predict the match results, rather than selecting players. You are scored against other users in a global league to see how you compare!

I've had to stop working on this due to the Covid situation postponing football in the UK until further notice, however I do plan to continue this next season. Until then, hopefully the source code proves resourceful.
